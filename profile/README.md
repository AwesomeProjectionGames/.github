# Welcome!
Welcome to Awesome Projection, an independent video game studio based in French-speaking Switzerland.
Since 2013, we have been creating all kinds of games and experiences that are always more fun to share with friends.
Our goal is to offer innovative and original games that take players into fantastic and amazing universes. We are therefore constantly looking for new styles and ideas to create games that stand out from the ordinary.
